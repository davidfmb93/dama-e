# Endpoint Framework


1. We create a project in express. go to the following link: https://expressjs.com/es/starter/installing.html
2. Second. We install express dependencies and run the principal file index.js. GO for more inf https://expressjs.com/es/starter/hello-world.html
3. To refresh every save we install a new dependence called nodemon, run our aplication with these comands. https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon
4. We can use fetch, curl or other like interfaces for petition Http. In this case we are going to use axios, 
5. I create a command inside packaje.json to run automatically nodemon. go straight to script inside package.json
6. We install   esm library to import and export in oir project. https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm
